### Medical Relation Extraction and Concept Normalization in Spanish Clinical Trial Texts

This repository includes the version 3 of the corpus of clinical trials for evidence-based medicine in Spanish.

A collection of __1200 texts about clinical trials__:
- __500 abstracts__ published in medical journals available from [SciELO](https://scielo.org/es/)
- __700 clinical trials announcements__ from the [Spanish Clinical Trials Register](https://reec.aemps.es) and the [European Register of Clinical Trials (EudraCT)]([https://scielo.org/es/](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu))

The repository also includes the code for the experiments on medical relation extraction and concept normalization.

Please, read the guidelines in the repository to check the entity and relation scheme and the concept normalization criteria.
